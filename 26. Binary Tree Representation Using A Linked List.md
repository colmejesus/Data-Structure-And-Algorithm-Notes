## Here's the structure of a Binary Tree, which is made up of data structures known as nodes, each node can at most two 'child nodes'. Every Tree node will store some data inside it and have a reference to a left node and a right node, which again will store some data inside them and refer to a left and right nodes of their own, hence the tree structure. 

## A user can perform several function on a Tree Node:

1. getData() : It gets the data from the node upon which it is called on. 
2. setData(): It inserts the data passed as argument into the node this method is called upon. 
3. Treenode getLeft(): It will return the reference to the left node stored inside a node, upon which this method is being called on. 
4. Treenode getRight(): It will return the reference to the right node stored inside a node, upon which this method is being called on. 
5. setRight(Treenode): It will set the node passed as an argument as the right node of the node on which it is called upon. 
6. setLeft(Treenode): It will set the node passed as an argument as the left node of the node on which it is called upon. 

Here's a pictorial representation of the structure of a Binary Tree implemented using linked list, with all the variables, references and operations it comprises:

## Implementing the TreeNode Class:

Since there is no pre-defined data structure known as a Tree Node, we need to define a structure for it ourselves, including all the functions related to a node which we discussed earlier. Here's how to do it:

``` java

class TreeNode {

private int data;
private TreeNode left;
private TreeNode right;
public TreeNode() {
	data=0; 
	left=null; 
	right=null
	}
public TreeNode(int d) { 
	int data=d; 
	left=null; 
	right=null 
	}
public TreeNode(int d, TreeNode l, TreeNode r) {
	int data=d; 
	left=l;
	right=r;
	}
public void getData(int d) {
	return data;
	}
public void setData(int d) {
	data=d;
	}	
public getRight() {
	return right;
	}
public setRight(Treenode n) {
	right=n;
	}
public getLeft() {
	return left;
	}
public setLeft(Treenode n) {
	left=n;
	}		
}
```


## Binary Tree Class:

A binary Tree class is needed to declare a binary tree we just defined, it is also used to declare an insert node function which is used to insert a node in the root node it is passed on, in the position specified as an argument inside the function, and it also declares a function for in-order, pre-order and post order traversal i.e. visiting each node of the tree in a specified order and doing the desired processing, and it contains a reference to the root node. Here's a pictorial representation of the Binary Tree Class:

## Binary Tree Traversal: Pre-Order

### Pre-order traversal on a binary tree follows the pattern of 'Root, Left, Right' i.e. In pre-order traversal we first visit the root node, then visit the right subtree and after visiting the right subtree we visit the right subtree:

### Here's the algorithm we follow if we want to traverse a tree in pre-order traversal. We will use the Stack as a data structure here as it is easy to use to keep track of what node we visited, in order we visited them, as the stack follows LIFO (Last In First Order) principle i.e. the last element that was put in it comes out will be the first one to be accessed for processing, you can only retrieve data from stack in that order, think of it like a glass with coins stacked inside of it, the coin you put in last will the first one to come out, note that this is not a proper implementation of the traversal, just a rough implementation to get the point across:

```java
Stack = s;
r = root;
while(1){
	while(r!=null){ // This condition checks if the node it is on is not null
	visit r;
	print r;
	Push(S,r) // After visiting and printing the not null node it pushes the root into the stack. 
	r = r.getLeft //After pushing the node into the stack S we get it's left node and assign that left node as the new root node. 
	}
	if(S.empty()) break; // This can be called the base condition i.e. the condition that stops the infinite while loop, it checks weather the stack which we were using to store numbers is empty, if it is, we break out of the loop
	r=pop; 
	r=r.getRight;
}
```

### Here's a step by step break down of the pre-order traversal algorithm we just implemented above: 

1. 'r' points to the root of the tree, in our case initially the root of the tree is set to '1'.
2. We initiate a Stack 'S' and set r (which is '1') as the root of the tree.

3. We check if the root is not null, it is not, so we go on to visit the root node and print it.

4. We then push the root value 'r(1)' into the stack 'S'  

5. After that we get the left value of the root node r(1)which is 2 and set it as the new root value. Now r=2.

6. We once again go to the inner while loop to check if r is null, it is not, so we visit the node and print it. 

7. After printing r(2) we push it into the stack 'S' and go on to get the left value of r(2) which is null. 'r' is now set to null -> r(null)

8. We once again go to the inner while loop to check if r is null, this time it is null, so we break out of the inner while loop and check if the stack S is empty, since it is not, we move on to the next line. 

9. Next line pops the Stack i.e. removes the last element i.e. 2 and stores it into r, which becomes the new root value. 

10. Moving on to the next line, we try to get the right node of 'r' which in our case is null and set it as the new root value. So 'r' is null -> r(null)

11. We once again enter the inner while loop and check if 'r' is not null and in our case it is, so we break out of the while loop and go on to check if the stack 'S' is empty, it is not. 

12. We then move on to the next like which pops i.e. removes the last stored node i.e. '1' and set it as the new root value -> r is now set to '1' i.e. r(1)

13. We now get the right node of r(1) which is '3' and set the 'r' to 3 -> r is now r(3)

14. We once again go to the inner while loop to check if r is null, it is not, so we visit the node r(3) and print it. 

15. After printing r(3) we push it into the stack 'S' and go on to get the left value of r(3) which is '6' so we set 'r' to '6' -> r(6)

16. We once again go to the inner while loop to check if r is null, it is not, so we visit the node and print it. 

17. After printing r(6) we push it into the stack 'S' and go on to get the left value of r(6) which is null. 'r' is now set to null -> r(null)

18. We once again go to the inner while loop to check if r is null, this time it is null, so we break out of the inner while loop and check if the stack S is empty, since it is not, we move on to the next line. 

19. Next line pops the Stack i.e. removes the last element i.e. 6 and stores it into r, which becomes the new root value ->r(6)

20. Moving on to the next line, we try to get the right node of 'r' which in our case is '4' and set it as the new root value. So 'r' is '4' -> r(4)

21. We now get the right node of r(4) which is null and set the 'r' to null-> r is now r(null)

22. We once again go to the inner while loop to check if r is null, this time it is null, so we break out of the inner while loop and check if the stack S is empty, since it is not, we move on to the next line. 

23. Next line pops the Stack i.e. removes the last element i.e. 6 and stores it into r, which becomes the new root value ->r(3) 

24. Moving on to the next line, we try to get the right node of 'r' which in our case is '5' and set it as the new root value. So 'r' is '5' -> r(5)

25. We once again go to the inner while loop to check if r is null, it is not, so we visit the node r(5) and print it. 

26. After printing r(5) we push it into the stack 'S' and go on to get the left value of r(5) which is null. 'r' is now set to null -> r(null)

27. We once again go to the inner while loop to check if r is null, this time it is null, so we break out of the inner while loop and check if the stack S is empty, since the stack is now completely empty, we break out of the outer while loop and the program terminates.

Level-Order Traversal Of Binary Tree

```java
public void levelorder(TreeNode r){
		Deque<TreeNode> Q = new ArrayDeque<TreeNode>();
		Q.offer(r);//inserting to rear
		while(!Q.isEmpty()) {
			TreeNode t=Q.poll();//Removes data from front and puts it inside 't' variable
			System.out.print(t.getData());
		if(t.getLeft()!=null)Q.offer(t.getLeft());
		if(t.getRight()!=null)Q.offer(t.getRight());
		}
	}
```

### Step-by-step implementation of level order traversal of a Binary Tree in using queue.

### First, let's go through the code step by step:

1.  `public void levelorder(TreeNode r){` - This is the method declaration for the level order traversal. The input parameter is the root node of the binary tree.
    
2.  `Deque<TreeNode> Q = new ArrayDeque<TreeNode>();` - Here, we are creating a new Deque (double-ended queue) object of TreeNode type using the ArrayDeque implementation. This will be used to keep track of the nodes in the binary tree as we traverse it.
    
3.  `Q.offer(r);` - We add the root node of the binary tree to the Deque. The offer() method adds the element to the rear of the queue.
    
4.  `while(!Q.isEmpty()) {` - We start a while loop that runs as long as there are elements in the Deque.
    
5.  `TreeNode t=Q.poll();` - We remove the element at the front of the Deque and store it in a temporary variable t using the poll() method. This means that we are processing the nodes in the binary tree from left to right, one level at a time.
    
6.  `System.out.print(t.getData());` - We print the data of the current node that we are processing.
    
7.  `if(t.getLeft()!=null)Q.offer(t.getLeft());` - We check if the current node has a left child, and if it does, we add it to the Deque using the offer() method. This is how we keep track of the nodes at the next level of the binary tree.
    
8.  `if(t.getRight()!=null)Q.offer(t.getRight());` - We do the same check for the right child of the current node, and if it exists, we add it to the Deque.
    
9.  The while loop continues to run until all the nodes in the binary tree have been processed.
    

Overall, this implementation is a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach that processes the nodes in a level-by-level manner, starting from the root node and moving down to the leaf nodes. This is why it is called a level order traversal.

## Implementing pre-order traversal using recursion: 

Here's an implementation of pre-order traversal using recursion, as you can notice it is very few lines of code compared to the previous implementation:

```java
public void preorder(TreeNode r){
	if(r!=null){
		System.out.println(r.getData() + " ")
		preorder(r.getLeft());
		preorder(r.getRight());
	}
}
```

Here's a detailed video explaining the step by step execution of recursive pre-order traversal of the binary tree:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R4V4n-waxn4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Binary Tree Insertion Function Implementation:

```java
void insertNode(TreeNode ParentNode, int data, char pos) {
	TreeNode newnode = new TreeNode(data);
	if(ParentNode==null) {
		root=ParentNode;
	}
	else {
	 if(pos=='L') {
		 ParentNode.setLeft(newnode);
	 } 
	 else {ParentNode.setLeft(newnode);}	
}
```

In this function, we give the parent node of the node we want to insert (`ParentNode`), the data as (`int data`) we want to insert inside the node we will be inserting to the left or right of the parent node, and the position we want to insert it in i.e. 'L' for left node and 'R' for right node as (char pos), as the arguments of the insert function. 

Then we create a new TreeNode Object, called `newnode` and pass the `data` we want to insert inside that node as an argument, this will create a new node and set it as the root node of the tree, if we are calling this function for the very first time and haven't created a root node yet, this if statement:`if(ParentNode==null)` is supposed to check if we have passed null as the parent node argument as there is no tree that is created yet and set the newly created node as the root node of the tree since it is the first node, otherwise if the `ParentNode` parameter is not null that implies that this is not the first node i.e. the root node of the tree, in that case we will check for the `pos` argument and set the `ParentNode` to the left of right of the tree according to the passed argument. 

## Here is a complete implementation of a Binary Tree using linked list: 

```java
class TreeNode {
    private int data;
    private TreeNode left;
    private TreeNode right;

    public TreeNode() {
        data=0;
        left=null;
        right=null;
    }

    public TreeNode(int d) {
        data=d;
        left=null;
        right=null;
    }

    public TreeNode(int d, TreeNode l, TreeNode r) {
        data=d;
        left=l;
        right=r;
    }

    public int getData() {
        return data;
    }

    public void setData(int d) {
        data=d;
    }

    public void setLeft(TreeNode n) {
        left=n;
    }

    public void setRight(TreeNode n) {
        right=n;
    }

    public TreeNode getLeft() {
        return left;
    }

    public TreeNode getRight() {
        return right;
    }
}

public class BinaryTree {
    private TreeNode root;

    public BinaryTree() {
        root=null;
    }

    public void insertNode(TreeNode parent, int data, char pos) {
        TreeNode newnode = new TreeNode(data);
        if(parent==null) {
            root=newnode;
        } else {
            if(pos=='L') {
                parent.setLeft(newnode);
            } else if(pos=='R') {
                parent.setRight(newnode);
            }
        }
    }

	public void preorder(TreeNode r){
	if(r!=null){
		System.out.println(r.getData() + " ")
		preorder(r.getLeft());
		preorder(r.getRight());
	}
}	
	public void levelorder(TreeNode r){
		Deque<TreeNode> Q = new ArrayDeque<TreeNode>();
		Q.offer(r);//inserting to rear
		while(!Q.isEmpty()) {
			TreeNode t=Q.poll();//Removes data from front and puts it inside 't' variable
			System.out.print(t.getData());
		if(t.getLeft()!=null)Q.offer(t.getLeft());
		if(t.getRight()!=null)Q.offer(t.getRight());
		}
	}
    public TreeNode getRoot() {
        return root; 
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BinaryTree t = new BinaryTree();
        t.insertNode(null, 25, 'L');
        TreeNode r = t.getRoot();
        t.insertNode(r, 34, 'R');
    }
}

```
