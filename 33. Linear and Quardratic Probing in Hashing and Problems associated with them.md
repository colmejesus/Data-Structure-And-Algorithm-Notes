### Linear Probing:

Linear probing is a common technique used in closed hashing to resolve collisions in hash tables. When a collision occurs and the first hash function maps a key to a slot that is already occupied, linear probing checks the next slot in the table until an empty slot is found. Specifically, the next slot to check is calculated as (current_slot + 1) % table_size, where table_size is the number of slots in the hash table.

While linear probing can be effective at resolving collisions, it can also lead to a problem called **primary clustering**. Primary clustering occurs when keys that hash to nearby slots in the table tend to cluster together. As a result, the search for an empty slot after a collision is more likely to lead to another collision, which can in turn lead to more clustering. Over time, the clustering can become more and more severe, resulting in slower retrieval times and reduced performance of the hash table.

One solution to the problem of primary clustering is to use a more sophisticated collision resolution technique, such as quadratic probing or double hashing. These techniques involve checking slots in a more systematic way, which can help to reduce clustering and improve the performance of the hash table. Another solution is to use a technique called rehashing, which involves creating a new hash table with a larger number of slots and rehashing all the keys from the old table into the new one. This can help to distribute the keys more evenly and reduce clustering.



### Quadratic Probing

It is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables. When a collision occurs and a hash function generates the same slot for multiple keys, quadratic probing tries to find the next available empty slot by incrementing the slot index by successive squares of an offset value. In other words, if the first hash function maps a key to slot i and a collision occurs, quadratic probing checks slot (i + 1), (i + 1^2), (i + 2^2), (i + 3^2), and so on until an empty slot is found or the entire hash table is searched. The offset value can be adjusted based on the specific application and hash table size.

Quadratic probing is a variation of linear probing and can help reduce the clustering of keys that can occur with linear probing. However, it may not be as effective as other collision resolution techniques, such as double hashing or chaining. Quadratic probing can also lead to slower retrieval times if the hash table becomes highly clustered.

**Secondary clustering** occurs when keys with different hash indices but the same quadratic offset value (i.e., the same number of steps away from the initial hash index) collide repeatedly. This can happen if the offset value is not chosen carefully, or if the hash table becomes too full. When secondary clustering occurs, retrieval times for keys with these offset values can become much slower, since the quadratic probing algorithm has to search through many occupied slots before finding the correct key.

To reduce secondary clustering in quadratic probing, one approach is to use a different offset value for each key. This can be achieved by using double hashing, which involves calculating a second hash function for each key and using the result as the offset value. Alternatively, a randomized probing sequence can be used, where the offset value is chosen randomly for each key. Another approach is to periodically rehash the keys into a larger hash table to reduce clustering.

Suppose we have a hash table with a size of 10 slots, and we want to insert the following keys: 23, 17, 46, 30, 22, 10, 38, 12, 7, 34. We use a hash function that takes the modulo of the key with the table size to determine the initial hash index.

When we insert the keys using quadratic probing, we find that some keys collide repeatedly at the same offset value, leading to secondary clustering. For example, the keys 17 and 34 both collide at an offset of 2 from their initial hash index, and the keys 30 and 38 both collide at an offset of 1.

To resolve this secondary clustering, we can use double hashing instead of quadratic probing. We define a second hash function that takes the modulo of the key with a different prime number, say 7. Then, the offset value for each key is calculated as the result of the second hash function. For example, the offset value for key 17 is (7 - (17 % 7)), which is equal to 4. The offset value for key 34 is (7 - (34 % 7)), which is equal to 3.

Using double hashing, we can insert all the keys into the hash table without any collisions or clustering. Retrieval times for the keys are also improved since there is no longer any secondary clustering.

#### Choosing the prime number to resolve secondary clustering: 

The choice of the prime number used in the second hash function for double hashing is typically not random, but rather chosen based on some heuristics.

One common heuristic for choosing the prime number is to use a prime that is close in size to the hash table size. The idea is to choose a prime that is not too close to a power of 2 or other common factors, which can help to avoid clustering in the hash table. Additionally, the prime should be relatively large compared to the keys being hashed, to reduce the chance of collisions.

Another heuristic is to choose a prime number that is coprime to the hash table size. This means that the prime number has no common factors with the hash table size, except for 1. This can help to ensure that the offset values generated by the second hash function are distributed evenly across the hash table.

In practice, there are several techniques for generating a suitable prime number for the second hash function. Some common methods include precomputing a table of prime numbers and selecting one based on the hash table size, or using a deterministic algorithm to find the next largest prime number after the hash table size.
