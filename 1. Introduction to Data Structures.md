## Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data into computer's memory so that it can be accessed efficiently using various programming languages. Some of the most common data structures include Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queues, Graphs and Trees. 

## Each data structure has it's own strengths and benefints therefore choosing the correct data structure can have big benefits for example Arrays are useful when we frequently need to quickly access the data you've stored, which can be very easily done if the index associated with that piece of data is known or when you need to sort the stored data which can also be easily sorted using various algorithms like Bubble Sort or Merge Sort whereas data structure like Stack which follows the principle of LIFO (Last In First Out) are used to keep track of order in which the data is added, an example of how Stack is effecient in certain cases can be seen in how your web browser's navigation function works, when a user clicks on a link the page requested is 'pushed' (term used for inserting an item on the top of the stack) into a stack and when the user click the back button it the last page he visited gets 'popped' (pop is the term used when we remove the data item from the top of the stack) out of the stack and user can access it again,  since arrays don't support this LIFO principles like stacks so when an item is inserted in an array and if we were using it for the navigation purpose I just stated above, we would need to, in order to insert the last page we accessed  at the first position in the array, shift all the element after inserting the web address of the page at the first memory location in the array, making it inefficient. 

## Therefore we can see that some data structures are better suited at a perticular job compared to others.
