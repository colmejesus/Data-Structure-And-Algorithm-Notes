A Graph data structure is used to represent objects (nodes or vertices) and relationships between them (edges). They can be used to represent a wide variety of real world situations like computer networks, maps, social networks and more.

The components of a graph include:

Nodes/Vertices: These are the objects represented in a graph. They can be connected by edges to other nodes in a graph. 

Edges: Are the connections between two nodes/vertices in a graph. They can be either directed (follow a specific direction) or undirected (do not follow a specific direction, i.e. can be traversed in either direction)

Weight: This is the number assigned to edges in a graph to represent the 'cost' or 'Distance' between two nodes. It can be used to represent factors like time, distance, or cost.

Here's a pictorial representation of a graph data structure:

## Types of Graphs:

1.  Directed Graphs: In directed graphs, the edges have a specific direction. This means that an edge from node A to node B is not the same as an edge from node B to node A. Directed graphs are also called Digraphs. Here's a pictorial representation:

2.  Undirected Graphs: In undirected graphs, the edges do not have a specific direction. This means that an edge connecting node A and node B can be traversed in either direction. Here's a pictorial representation:

3.  Weighted Graphs: In weighted graphs, each edge has a numerical value assigned to it, called a weight. This weight represents a "cost" or "distance" between two nodes, and can be used to represent factors such as distance, time, or cost. Here's a pictorial representation:

4.  Unweighted Graphs: In unweighted graphs, all edges have the same value or weight, typically assumed to be 1. Here's a pictorial representation:

5.  Connected Graphs: In connected graphs, every node is connected to at least one other node. This means that there is a path between any two nodes in the graph.
    
6.  Disconnected Graphs: In disconnected graphs, there are one or more nodes that are not connected to any other nodes in the graph.

 Here's a pictorial representation of Both connected and disconnected graphs:

7.  Complete Graphs: In complete graphs, every node is connected to every other node in the graph. Here's a pictorial representation:

8.  Bipartite Graphs: In bipartite graphs, the nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a node from one set to a node from the other set. Here's a pictorial representation of it:

9.  Trees: Trees are special kinds of graphs that do not contain any cycles. They have a root node, and every other node in the tree can be reached from the root node.

#### Degree of a Vertex: 

Degree of vertex is the number of edges 'Incident' i.e. connected to any particular vertex. For example, consider this graph:

#### In-degree and Out-degree of a vertex in directed graphs: In-degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected through their head part, from a node, whereas out-degree of a node is the number of edges connected through their tail part from a node. Here's an example:

### What is a path?

A path in a graph is a sequence of adjacent vertices, and the length of the path is calculated by adding the total number of edges in that path.

Simple path: A path in which all vertices except possibly the first and last are distinct. For example, in the give graph, the path from A to C i.e. A, B, C is a simple path but the path A, B, C, F, B, E, F cannot be called a simple path since we have a few vertices that are repeating in the path. 

Also, A, D, G cannot be called a path since the node A is not connected to D and D is not connected to the node G.

### What is a Cycle in a graph?

A cycle is a simple path in a graph in which the first and the last vertices are the same. 

### What is a spanning Sub-graph?

A spanning sub-graph of a graph data structure is a sub-graph that includes all the vertices of the original graph, but only a subset of the edges when compared to the original graph.

### What is a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)?

DAG is a directed graph which does not have a cyclic path, i.e. The first and the last nodes are not the same. DAGs are often used to represent dependencies between tasks and events.
