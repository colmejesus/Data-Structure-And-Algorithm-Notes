## A Circular Linked List is a variation of the Linked List Abstract Data Type (ADT) where the last node in the list points back to the head node, forming a circular chain.

## In a Circular Linked List, each node contains an element and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The head node in a circular linked list points to the next node, and the tail node points back to the head node, forming a circular chain. Unlike a regular linked list, there is no end to a circular linked list, as it continuously loops from the head node back to itself.

## Circular linked lists provide the same basic operations as linked lists, such as inserting an element at any position in the list, deleting an element from any position in the list, searching for an element in the list, and traversing the list. However, the circular nature of a circular linked list provides the additional advantage of efficient traversal, as it is possible to traverse the list indefinitely without having to stop at the end of the list.

## In a linked list, including a circular linked list, each node contains both data and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the list. The head node is the first node in the list and is usually used to represent the start of the list.

## Therefore, the head node in a linked list, including a circular linked list, typically contains data just like any other node in the list. The only difference between the head node and other nodes in the list is that the head node is the starting point for accessing the rest of the list.

## In some implementations, the head node may also have additional properties or fields that are used to identify it as the head node, such as a flag or a special value in one of its fields. However, the most common way to identify the head node is simply by the fact that it is the first node in the list and is referenced by a special pointer or variable.


## Implementation of The Circular Linked List:

```java
// Define the node class
class Node {
  int data;
  Node next;

  // constructor to initialize the node with data and next
  public Node(int data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

// Define the circular linked list class
class CircularLinkedList {
  Node head;

  // constructor to initialize the head node
  public CircularLinkedList() {
    head = null;
  }

  // method to insert a new node at the end of the list
  public void insert(int data) {
    // create a new node
    Node newNode = new Node(data);

    // check if the list is empty
    if (head == null) {
      head = newNode;
      newNode.next = head;
    } else {
      // get a reference to the last node in the list
      Node last = head;
      while (last.next != head) {
        last = last.next;
      }
      // insert the new node at the end of the list
      last.next = newNode;
      newNode.next = head;
    }
  }

  // method to delete a node from the list
  public void delete(int data) {
    // check if the list is empty
    if (head == null) {
      return;
    }

    // get a reference to the node to be deleted
    Node current = head;
    Node previous = null;
    while (current.next != head && current.data != data) {
      previous = current;
      current = current.next;
    }

    // check if the node was found in the list
    if (current.data != data) {
      return;
    }

    // check if the node to be deleted is the only node in the list
    if (current == head && current.next == head) {
      head = null;
    } else if (current == head) {
      // update the head node if the node to be deleted is the head node
      head = current.next;
      Node last = head;
      while (last.next != head) {
        last = last.next;
      }
      last.next = head;
    } else {
      // delete the node from the list
      previous.next = current.next;
    }
  }

  // method to display the list
  public void display() {
    // check if the list is empty
    if (head == null) {
      return;
    }
    // get a reference to the first node in the list
    Node current = head;
    // loop through the list and print each node's data
    do {
      System.out.print(current.data + " ");
      current = current.next;
    } while (current != head);
    System.out.println();
  }
}

```
