#### Implementation of Deletion Function

```java
public void delete(int value) {
        root = deleteNode(root, value);
    }
 
    private Node deleteNode(Node current, int value) {
        if (current == null) {
            return null;
        }
 
        if (value < current.data) {
            current.left = deleteNode(current.left, value);
            return current;
        } else if (value > current.data) {
            current.right = deleteNode(current.right, value);
            return current;
        } else {
            // node found
            if (current.left == null && current.right == null) {
                return null;
            } else if (current.right == null) {
                return current.left;
            } else if (current.left == null) {
                return current.right;
            } else {
                int smallestValue = findSmallest(current.right);
                current.data = smallestValue;
                current.right = deleteNode(current.right, smallestValue);
                return current;
            }
        }
    }
```

#### Now suppose we need to delete `80` from the given binary tree:

```javascript
        50
      /    \
     30     70
    /  \    /  \
   20  40  60   80
```

##### Here's how our implementation will work:

The delete method is called with the value to be deleted (80), which sets root as the root node of the binary tree and passes it along with the value to be deleted to the deleteNode method.

The deleteNode method first checks if the current node is null, in which case it returns null. In this case, the current node is not null.

The method then checks if the value to be deleted (80) is less than the value of the current node (50). Since 80 is not less than 50, it moves on to the next else if statement.

The method then checks if the value to be deleted (80) is greater than the value of the current node (50). Since 80 is greater than 50, it sets current.right to the result of a recursive call to deleteNode with the right child of the current node (70) and the value to be deleted (80). This means that the search for the node to be deleted continues in the right subtree.

In the next iteration of the deleteNode method, the current node is now 70, and the method checks if the value to be deleted (80) is less than the value of the current node (70). Since 80 is not less than 70, it moves on to the next else if statement.

The method then checks if the value to be deleted (80) is greater than the value of the current node (70). Since 80 is greater than 70, it sets current.right to the result of a recursive call to deleteNode with the right child of the current node (80) and the value to be deleted (80).

In the next iteration of the deleteNode method, the current node is now 80, and the method checks if the value to be deleted (80) is equal to the value of the current node (80). Since 80 is equal to 80, it enters the else block, which means that the node has been found.

The method checks if the current node (80) has no children (both left and right are null). Since 80 has no children, it returns null, effectively removing the node from the binary tree.

The value null returned by the deleteNode method is then stored in the right child of 70.

The recursive calls to deleteNode then return up the call stack, updating the right child of 50 to null, as 70 no longer has a right child.

And that's it! The node with value 80 has been successfully deleted from the binary tree.

#### In this example the node with the value of 80 had no left or right children node as you can see in the binary tree above, but there might be cases where we might encounter a left child node or a right child node or both nodes of the node we want to delete, in that case we need to delete the node we want to while preserving its children node. Let's discuss how our implementation handles the edge cases:

### Let's take another very similar binary tree as an example:

```javascript
        50
      /    \
     30     70
    /      /  \
   20     60   80
```

### Now, let's suppose we want to delete the node which has the key of `30` in the tree above. Here's how our implementation handles this case:

 1.  `root = deleteNode(root, value)`: The `delete` method is called with the value `30` and sets the root of the binary tree to the result of calling `deleteNode` method on the root node and the value `30`.
    
2.  `private Node deleteNode(Node current, int value)`: The `deleteNode` method is called with `current` being the root node `50` and the value `30`.
    
3.  `if (current == null) { return null; }`: This condition is not met, so the execution continues.
    
4.  `if (value < current.data) { current.left = deleteNode(current.left, value); return current; }`: Since `30 < 50`, this block of code is executed and `current.left` is set to the result of calling `deleteNode` on the left child node `30` and the value `30`.
    
5.  `private Node deleteNode(Node current, int value)`: The `deleteNode` method is called again with `current` being the node with value `30` and the value `30`.
    
6.  `if (current == null) { return null; }`: This condition is not met, so the execution continues.
    
7.  `else { // node found`: Since the current node has a value of `30` which is equal to the value we are looking to delete, the `else` block is executed.
    
8.  `if (current.left == null && current.right == null) { return null; }`: Since the node with value `30` has two children nodes `20` and `40`, this condition is not met.
    
9.  `else if (current.right == null) { return current.left; }`: Since the node with value `30` has a right child, this condition is not met.
    
10.  `else if (current.left == null) { return current.right; }`: Since the node with value `30` has a left child, this condition is not met.
    
11.  `else { int smallestValue = findSmallest(current.right); current.data = smallestValue; current.right = deleteNode(current.right, smallestValue); return current; }`: This block is executed since the node with value `30` has two children, and sets the current node's value to the smallest value in its right subtree, which is `40` in this case. Then the node with value `40` is deleted using a recursive call to `deleteNode`.
    
12.  The final result of this method call is that the node with value `30` is deleted from the binary tree, and the left child of the node with value `50` is set to the node with value `20`. The updated binary tree would look like this:

```javascript
        50
      /    \
     20     70
           /  \
          60   80
```

### Now let's discuss our final case where we need to delete 70 from the same Binary tree which has two child nodes, `60 and 80`:

```javascript
        50
      /    \
     30     70
    /      /  \
   20     60   80
```

#### Here's what is going to happen when we pass 70 as an argument in the delete function:*()

1.  The `delete` method is called with value `70`, and it sets the `root` to the result of the `deleteNode` method, which is passed `root` and `70` as arguments.
    
2.  The `deleteNode` method is called, with `root` (which is `50`) and `70` as arguments.
    
3.  The first line of the `deleteNode` method checks if the current node is null. Since `50` is not null, it moves to the next step.
    
4.  The next line compares `70` with the data of the current node, `50`. Since `70` is greater than `50`, it moves to the next step.
    
5.  The code sets `current.right = deleteNode(current.right, value)`, which means `current.right` (which was `70`) is now set to the result of calling `deleteNode` with `current.right` (which is `70`) and `70` as arguments.
    
6.  The `deleteNode` method is called again with `70` as the current node and `70` as the value to delete.
    
7.  The first line of the `deleteNode` method checks if the current node is null. Since `70` is not null, it moves to the next step.
    
8.  The next line compares `70` with the data of the current node, `70`. Since they are equal, it means the node to be deleted has been found, and it moves to the next step.
    
9.  The code checks if `current.left` and `current.right` are both null, which means the current node is a leaf node. Since `70` has two child nodes, `60` and `80`, it moves to the next step.
    
10.  The code checks if `current.right` is null. Since it's not, it moves to the next step.
    
11.  The code checks if `current.left` is null. Since it's not null, it moves to the next step.
    
12.  The `findSmallest(Current.right)` method returns `80` as the new value of the right child of the node `50`.
    
13.  The `delete` method sets the `root` of the binary tree to the new tree, with `70` removed and `80` taking its place in the tree.

This is how the code would work if you were trying to delete node `70` from the binary tree.

#### Here's how the new binary tree will look like:

```javascript
        50
      /    \
     30     80
    /      /  
   20     60   
```
