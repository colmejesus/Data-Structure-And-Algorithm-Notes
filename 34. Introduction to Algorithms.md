### What is an Algorithm?

An Algorithm is a well-defined set of sequential instructions, used for solving a computational problem. It can often times take a set of values as input and transform and return a ‘correct/expected’ set of output in finite amount of time. 

An algorithm should terminate after a finite number of steps and the instructions should be unambiguous, i.e. very clear. 

They have certain properties that make them useful and effective:

1. Finiteness: Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps. This means that there must be a clear end to the instructions given in the algorithm.

2. Input: Algorithms take input from some source, whether it be a user, a file, or some other source of data.

3. Output: Algorithms produce output, which is the result of applying the instructions to the input data.

4. Definiteness: Each step in an algorithm must be well-defined and unambiguous. This means that each instruction should be clear and concise, and there should be no room for interpretation.

5. Effectiveness: An algorithm must be effective in solving the problem it was designed to solve. This means that it must produce the correct output for all valid input.

6. Precision: Algorithms must be precise, meaning that they must be free from any vagueness or ambiguity.

7. Determinism: An algorithm must be deterministic, meaning that it will produce the same output for the same input every time it is run.

8. Modularity: Algorithms can be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces, making them easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

9. Generality: An algorithm can be applied to a wide range of input data, as long as it meets the requirements specified in the algorithm.

10. Efficiency: Algorithms should be designed to be efficient, meaning they should solve the problem with the least amount of time and resources possible.

### How are Algorithms Specified?

Algorithms can be specified using various ways, let’s discuss the two most common methods of specifying Algorithms - Flowcharts and Pseudocode.

#### Flowcharts:

A flowchart is a visual representation of an Algorithm, which uses various symbols like Rectangle, Diamond, Arrow to represent steps in algorithms. Rectangle represents steps, Diamond represent decision points in algorithms where the flow might branch out based on certain conditions (if/else, while conditional statements) and arrow connects the symbols to show the flow of the algorithm.

Flowcharts are useful in helping people in visualizing the steps in an algorithm. They are easy to read and modify, making them a good tool for collaboration.

Here’s what a flowchart look like:

### Pseudocode:

Pseudocode is a high level informational way of writing code. It is not written in a specific programming language, but it uses keyword and symbols to represents various operations, data types etc. Pseudocode is not bound by the syntax rules of any programming language, which makes it a flexible way of representing an algorithm, as the user can focus on the logic of an algorithm rather than focusing on syntax rules and pseudocode is also easier to understand compared to normal code. Pseudocode can be translated into any programming language. 

Here's a simple example of pseudocode that adds two numbers together:

```
1. Start
2. Input the first number (num1)
3. Input the second number (num2)
4. Set the sum variable (sum) to 0
5. Add num1 and num2 together and store the result in the sum variable
6. Output the sum variable
7. Stop
```

This pseudocode describes a simple algorithm that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, and outputs the result. The algorithm starts by prompting the user to input the two numbers, then creates a variable to store the sum. It then adds the two numbers together and stores the result in the sum variable. Finally, the algorithm outputs the value of the sum variable and stops.

#### Algorithm Requirements:

To run an algorithm, there are several resources that may be required, including:

1. Processor/CPU: An algorithm requires a processor or CPU to execute the instructions.

2. Memory/RAM: An algorithm may need to use memory or RAM to store data or intermediate results while it is running.

3. Input devices: An algorithm may require input from devices such as a keyboard, mouse, or touch screen.

4. Output devices: An algorithm may need to display results on output devices such as a monitor or printer.

5. Storage devices: An algorithm may require access to storage devices such as hard drives or solid-state drives to read or write data.

6. Libraries: An algorithm may need to use software libraries to access pre-built functions or routines to perform specific tasks.

7. Network connectivity: An algorithm may require network connectivity to access data or services over a network.

8. External APIs: An algorithm may require access to external APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to interact with other software systems.

The specific resources required by an algorithm will depend on its purpose and the problem it is designed to solve. 

#### Algorithms Analysis:

##### Apriori Analysis:

Apriori analysis is a method of predicting the running time of an algorithm before it is actually executed. This involves analyzing the algorithm's code, data structures used, and the size of the input to estimate the number of basic operations, such as comparisons or assignments, performed by the algorithm. The result of apriori analysis is often expressed using big-O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time as the input size increases.

For example, suppose you have an algorithm that searches for a specific element in an array of n elements using linear search. In apriori analysis, you would examine the code of the algorithm and determine that it performs n comparisons in the worst case, since it needs to examine each element of the array. Therefore, the running time of the algorithm is O(n), meaning that the worst-case running time grows linearly with the input size.

Another example is quicksort, which is a popular sorting algorithm. In apriori analysis, the running time of quicksort is O(nlogn) on average, since the algorithm divides the input into smaller subproblems and then combines the solutions. However, in the worst case, quicksort can have a running time of O(n^2), making it less efficient than other sorting algorithms for certain inputs.

##### Aposteriori Analysis:

Aposteriori analysis involves measuring the actual running time of an algorithm on a particular input and using this information to draw conclusions about the algorithm's performance. This analysis is often done by running the algorithm multiple times on different inputs of varying sizes and observing how the running time varies as the input size increases. The result of aposteriori analysis is often expressed using average-case or worst-case analysis, which provides a more precise estimate of the algorithm's running time for particular types of inputs.

For example, suppose you have an algorithm that sorts an array of n elements using mergesort. In aposteriori analysis, you would run the algorithm multiple times on arrays of different sizes and compute the average running time for each size. This would allow you to estimate the average-case running time of the algorithm for various input sizes.
