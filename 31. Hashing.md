### What is Hashing?

Hashing is the process of mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values or keys. A hash function takes an input (also known as the message or plaintext) and produces a fixed-size output (also known as the hash or digest). The output is typically a unique representation of the input data, and even a small change in the input data will result in a vastly different output.

Hashing is commonly used in computer science for various purposes, including data integrity checks, password storage, digital signatures, and in hash tables used for fast data retrieval. In data integrity checks, a hash function is used to generate a hash value for a piece of data, and this value is then compared to the hash value of the same data at a later time to verify that the data has not been modified. In password storage, hash functions are used to convert user passwords into hash values, which are then stored in a database. When a user enters their password during login, the input password is hashed and compared to the stored hash value to verify the correctness of the password.

Hashing is also used in digital signatures, where a hash value of a message is encrypted using a private key to generate a digital signature, which can be verified using the corresponding public key. In hash tables, a hash function is used to map a key to an index in an array, allowing for fast retrieval of data associated with that key.

### Hashing Components:

The main components of a hashing algorithm include:

1.  **Input message:** This is the data that needs to be hashed. It can be any type of data, such as a password, file, or message.
    
2.  **Hash function:** This is the mathematical algorithm that takes the input message and produces a fixed-size output (the hash or digest). The hash function should be deterministic, meaning that given the same input, it should always produce the same output.
    
3.  **Hash value:** This is the fixed-size output produced by the hash function. The hash value should be unique, meaning that it is highly unlikely for two different input messages to produce the same hash value.
    
4.  **Collision resolution:** This refers to the process of dealing with the possibility of two different input messages producing the same hash value (known as a collision). Collision resolution can be achieved through various methods, such as chaining or open addressing.
    
5.  **Security properties:** Hashing algorithms should have certain security properties to make them resistant to attacks, such as preimage resistance (given a hash value, it should be difficult to find an input message that produces that hash value), second preimage resistance (given an input message, it should be difficult to find another message that produces the same hash value), and collision resistance (it should be difficult to find two different input messages that produce the same hash value).
    
6.  **Salt (optional):** This is an additional piece of data that is added to the input message before it is hashed. Salting can help prevent precomputed hash attacks and increase the security of password storage systems.

7. Hash Table: The Data Structure that stores the hash keys and their associated values.


### What's a Hash Function?

A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input message of arbitrary size and produces a fixed-size output (the hash or digest). A good hash function should have several important properties, including:


1.  **Determinism:** Given the same input message, a hash function should always produce the same hash value. This is necessary for the function to be useful in practical applications.
    
2.  **Uniformity:** A hash function should uniformly distribute the hash values across the entire output range. This means that each possible hash value should have an equal chance of being produced, regardless of the input message.
    
3.  **Uniqueness:** A good hash function should produce a unique hash value for each input message. While it is impossible to completely eliminate collisions (two different input messages producing the same hash value), a good hash function should minimize the likelihood of collisions.
    
4.  **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in the input message should produce a vastly different hash value. This is important for the security of applications such as password storage, where an attacker should not be able to determine the original password from the hash value.
    
5.  **Speed:** A hash function should be efficient and fast to compute, as it may be used for large amounts of data in applications such as digital signatures, data integrity checks, and hash tables.
    
6.  **Resistance to attacks:** A good hash function should be resistant to various attacks, such as preimage attacks, second preimage attacks, and collision attacks.
    
7.  **Cryptographic security:** If a hash function is to be used for cryptographic purposes such as password storage or digital signatures, it should have additional properties such as key-strengthening, salt support, and resistance to side-channel attacks.
    

Designing a good hash function is a complex task that involves balancing the above properties and ensuring that the function is resistant to various attacks. Many widely used hash functions, such as SHA-256 and SHA-3, have undergone extensive analysis and testing to ensure their security and efficiency.

### Basic Hash Functions:

#### Here are a few basic hash functions that are commonly used for simple hashing applications. Here's an overview of each of them:

1. Division Method: The division method is a simple hash function that involves taking the key and dividing it by a prime number. The remainder of the division is then used as the hash value. The prime number is usually chosen to be smaller than the size of the hash table to ensure that the hash value falls within the range of the table.
   Example: Suppose we have a hash table with 10 slots and we want to hash the key "42". We can use the division method with the prime number 7.

   Hash value = 42 % 7 = 0

Pros: This method is simple and easy to implement. It works well for small hash tables.

Cons: It can lead to clustering (multiple keys hashing to the same value) if the prime number is poorly chosen. Also, if the prime number is too small, the hash function may not distribute the keys evenly.

2. Mid Square Method: The mid square method is another basic hash function that involves squaring the key, taking the middle digits of the result, and using those digits as the hash value.
   Example: Suppose we have a hash table with 10 slots and we want to hash the key "42". We can use the mid square method as follows:

Square the key: 42^2 = 1764
Take the middle digits: 76
Hash value = 76 % 10 = 6

Pros: This method is easy to implement and can provide a good distribution of hash values for small hash tables.

Cons: This method may lead to poor distribution of hash values for larger hash tables, as the middle digits may not be representative of the key.

3. Digit Folding Method: The digit folding method involves dividing the key into equal-sized segments (digits or groups of digits), adding those segments together, and using the sum as the hash value.
Example: Suppose we have a hash table with 10 slots and we want to hash the key "123456". We can use the digit folding method by dividing the key into groups of 2 digits:

12 + 34 + 56 = 102
Hash value = 102 % 10 = 2

Pros: This method is easy to implement and can provide a good distribution of hash values for small to medium-sized hash tables.

Cons: This method may lead to poor distribution of hash values for very large hash tables, as the segments may not be representative of the key. Also, the size of the segments may need to be adjusted based on the size of the hash table to ensure even distribution.

### Storing String to Hash Table using remainder method/Modular Hashing:

Storing strings in a hash table by adding the ASCII values of each character in the string and then calculating the modulus by dividing by the table size is a simple hash function that can be used to efficiently store and retrieve strings.

#### The process involves the following steps:

Calculate the sum of the ASCII values of each character in the string.
Divide the sum by the size of the hash table (the number of slots in the table).
Take the remainder (modulus) of the division.
Store the string in the slot of the hash table corresponding to the remainder.
Example: Suppose we have a hash table with 10 slots and we want to store the string "hello". The ASCII values of each character are:

'h' = 104
'e' = 101
'l' = 108
'l' = 108
'o' = 111

The sum of the ASCII values is 532. If we divide this by 10 (the size of the hash table), we get 53 with a remainder of 2. Therefore, we store the string "hello" in slot 2 of the hash table.

To retrieve the string, we perform the same process using the key (in this case, the string) to calculate the hash value, and then retrieve the value stored in the corresponding slot.

#### What is Load Factor:

Load factor is a measure of how full a hash table is, expressed as the ratio of the number of keys stored in the table to the total number of slots in the table. In simple terms, it tells us how much of the hash table is being used to store data. For example, if a hash table has 100 slots and 50 keys stored in it, the load factor would be 0.5 (or 50%). A higher load factor indicates that the hash table is more full and may require more memory or slower retrieval times, while a lower load factor indicates that the table has more available space and may be able to handle additional keys without performance degradation.
