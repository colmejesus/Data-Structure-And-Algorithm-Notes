### What is Collision, and how do we resolve it?

Collision occurs when two or more keys are hashed to the same slot in a hash table. Here are some collision resolution techniques for the three hashing methods discussed above:

1. Division Method:

Collision Resolution: One common technique for handling collisions in the division method is to use **linear probing**. With linear probing, if a collision occurs, we simply check the next slot in the hash table until an empty slot is found. The key is then inserted in the first empty slot found.

- Pros: Simple and easy to implement.
- Cons: Can result in clustering, where long sequences of consecutive slots are filled, leading to slower retrieval times.



2. Mid-Square Method:

Collision Resolution: One common technique for handling collisions in the mid square method is to use **chaining**. With chaining, each slot in the hash table contains a linked list of keys that hash to that slot. When a collision occurs, the new key is simply added to the linked list in the appropriate slot.

- Pros: Can provide good distribution of keys and reduce clustering.

- Cons: Can result in slower retrieval times if the linked lists become very long.

3. Digit Folding Method:

Collision Resolution: One common technique for handling collisions in the digit folding method is to use **double hashing**. With double hashing, a second hash function is used to calculate the step size for checking the next slot in the hash table. If a collision occurs, we simply check the next slot using the step size calculated by the second hash function until an empty slot is found.

Pros: Can provide good distribution of keys and reduce clustering.

Cons: Can be more complex to implement than other collision resolution techniques.

It's worth noting that different collision resolution techniques may be more or less effective depending on the specific application and the characteristics of the keys being hashed.

### Open VS Closed Hashing:

Open hashing and closed hashing are two fundamental approaches to collision resolution in hash tables.

Open hashing, also known as **separate chaining**, involves creating a linked list of all the keys that hash to the same slot in the hash table. When a collision occurs, the new key is simply added to the linked list in the appropriate slot. Each slot in the hash table contains a pointer to the head of the linked list. Open hashing is relatively easy to implement and can be effective for handling collisions, but it can lead to slower retrieval times if the linked lists become very long.

Closed hashing, also known as open addressing or **probing**, involves searching for the next available slot in the hash table when a collision occurs. There are several techniques for determining the next available slot, including linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing. With closed hashing, all keys are stored directly in the hash table, and no additional memory is required for linked lists. However, it can be more difficult to implement and may result in clustering or slower retrieval times if the hash table becomes too full.

In summary, open hashing uses linked lists to handle collisions, while closed hashing uses additional probing to search for the next available slot in the hash table.
