Asymptotic notations are used to describe the behavior of a function as its input size approaches infinity. They are commonly used in computer science and mathematics to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.

There are three common asymptotic notations:

Big O notation: This notation represents the upper bound of a function's growth rate. In simpler terms, it describes how fast the function grows. For example, if a function has a Big O notation of O(n), it means that its growth rate is linear, meaning the function's runtime increases proportionally with the input size. Mathematically, f(n) = O(g(n)) if and only if there exist positive constants c and n0 such that f(n) <= c*g(n) for all n >= n0.

Omega notation: This notation represents the lower bound of a function's growth rate. In simpler terms, it describes how slow the function grows. For example, if a function has an Omega notation of Ω(n^2), it means that its growth rate is quadratic, meaning the function's runtime increases much faster than the input size. Mathematically, f(n) = Ω(g(n)) if and only if there exist positive constants c and n0 such that f(n) >= c*g(n) for all n >= n0.

Theta notation: This notation represents both the upper and lower bounds of a function's growth rate. In simpler terms, it describes how tightly the function is bounded. For example, if a function has a Theta notation of Θ(n), it means that its growth rate is linear, and it is tightly bounded by a constant factor. Mathematically, f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if and only if there exist positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that c1g(n) <= f(n) <= c2g(n) for all n >= n0.
