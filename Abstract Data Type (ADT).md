### Abstract Data Type defines the behaviour of a data structure without secifying how it will be implemented, it acts as a blueprint of a data structure by providing a clear and consice interface to interact with the data structure. 

### It defines what operations can be performed on the data structure and what the expected behaviour of the data structure should be regardless of underlying implementation.

## Examples of ADT :

### Array: ADT for Array specifies that it will be used to store a fixed sized collection of homogeneous data (data of same type) and basic operations it will support are inserting an element in the array, retrieve element from the array, deleting an element, sorting the array, finding the size of the array. An ADT can also specify the maximum size of an array and that the elements are stored in a contiguous memory location and can be accessed by their index in constant time, it can also specify the type of elements an array will store and the behavior when the array is full or empty. 

### Dictionary: ADT of dictionary specifies that data should be organized in a Key-Value pair, and the basic operations supported by a dictionary should be adding, removing and retrieving elements based on a key. 

### Stack: ADT of Stack specifies that data should be organized in LIFO (Last In First Out) order and the basic operations supported by stack are push (inserting an element at the top of the stack), pop (removing the topmost element of the stack), isEmpty, isFull, top(Displays the top most element of a stack)
