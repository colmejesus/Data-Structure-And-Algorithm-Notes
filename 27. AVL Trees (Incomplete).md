## An AVL tree is a type of binary search tree that is self-balancing. In a binary search tree, each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. The left child has a smaller value than the parent node, and the right child has a larger value than the parent node. This allows us to quickly search for a specific value in the tree by comparing it to the values of the nodes in the tree and moving left or right accordingly.

## However, in a normal binary search tree, if we insert elements in a way that creates a skewed tree, where one side of the tree has many more levels than the other side, the search can become slow. AVL trees are designed to address this issue by maintaining a balance between the left and right subtrees of each node.

## For example, this is a skewed binary tree:

```javascript 
20
  \
   30
     \
      40
        \
         50
          \
           60
```

## In a balanced tree like an AVL tree, the time complexity of searching for an element is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree. This is much faster than searching in a skewed binary tree, where the time complexity of searching for an element is O(n), which means that the worst-case scenario could require us to search through all 1000 elements.

## So, in the case of an AVL tree, we can find the target element in log2(1000) or approximately 10 comparisons on average, which is the same as binary search. Here's how we can compare the time complexity of searching for an element in an AVL tree to a skewed binary tree using the example of a list of 1000 elements:

### In an AVL tree:

-   We start by comparing the target element with the root of the tree.
-   If the target element is less than the root, we move to the left subtree and repeat the process.
-   If the target element is greater than the root, we move to the right subtree and repeat the process.
-   At each step, we eliminate half of the remaining elements in the tree.
-   Therefore, the number of elements we need to search after each comparison in an AVL tree will be similar to the example of binary search:
    -   1st comparison: 1000 elements
    -   2nd comparison: 500 elements
    -   3rd comparison: 250 elements
    -   4th comparison: 125 elements
    -   5th comparison: 63 elements
    -   6th comparison: 32 elements
    -   7th comparison: 16 elements
    -   8th comparison: 8 elements
    -   9th comparison: 4 elements
    -   10th comparison: 2 elements
-   At this point, we have only two elements left in the AVL tree, and we can perform one final comparison to determine if the target element is in the tree.
-   Since an AVL tree is a balanced binary search tree, the height of the tree is always logarithmic, which means that the worst-case time complexity of searching for an element in an AVL tree is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree.
-   In the case of an AVL tree, we can find the target element in log2(1000) or approximately 10 comparisons on average, which is the same as binary search.

### In a skewed binary tree:

-   We start by comparing the target element with the root of the tree.
-   If the target element is less than the root, we move to the left subtree and repeat the process.
-   If the target element is greater than the root, we move to the right subtree and repeat the process.
-   In a skewed binary tree, there is no guarantee that the left and right subtrees will be balanced. (Like in the example we discussed earlier, where all the elements of the tree were skewed to the right)
-   Therefore, the number of elements we need to search after each comparison can vary greatly, depending on the shape of the tree.
-   In the worst-case scenario, we might need to search through all 1000 elements in the tree to find the target element.
-   Therefore, the time complexity of searching for an element in a skewed binary tree is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the tree.
-   This is much slower than searching in an AVL tree, where the worst-case time complexity is O(log n).


## Also, unlike binary search, an AVL tree allows us to perform other operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal in logarithmic time complexity as well, making it a more versatile and efficient data structure.

## The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root node to the furthest leaf node. In other words, it is the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. A leaf node is a node that has no children.

### The balance factor of a node in an AVL tree is the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees. A node is said to be balanced if its balance factor is 0, meaning that its left and right subtrees have the same height. A node is said to be left-heavy if its balance factor is positive, meaning that its left subtree is taller than its right subtree. A node is said to be right-heavy if its balance factor is negative, meaning that its right subtree is taller than its left subtree.

### A rotation is a type of operation we perform on an AVL tree to maintain its balance. A rotation is used to move a node in the tree to a different position while maintaining the order of the tree. There are two types of rotations: left rotation and right rotation.

### Here's an example of how to calculate the balance factor and perform a rotation on a 4-5 level skewed binary search tree:

### Suppose we have the following skewed binary search tree:

```javascript
       10
        \
         20
          \
           30
            \
             40
              \
               50

```

```yaml
height of left subtree: 0
height of right subtree: 4 (counting the 4 edges to node 50)
balance factor: -4

```

### The node with value 20 is right-heavy because its right subtree is much taller than its left subtree.

### To balance the tree, we can perform a left rotation on the node with value 20. Here's what the tree looks like after the rotation:

```javascript
        30
       /  \
     20   40
    /     /  \
  10    35   50

```

### After the rotation, the height of the tree is 3, and each node has a balance factor of -1, 0, or 1, which means that the tree is now balanced.

### In summary, AVL trees are binary search trees that are designed to maintain balance between the left and right subtrees of each node. The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf node. The balance factor of a node is the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees.
