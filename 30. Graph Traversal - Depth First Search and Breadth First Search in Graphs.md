Depth first search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts from any chosen starting Vertex and then explore as far as possible along each of the neighboring vertices until there are no more vertices to explore before backtracking. During the traversal, the algorithm keeps track of the visited vertices and the order in which they were visited. The algorithm is called "Depth First Search" because it explores the depth of each branch of a graph before moving on to the next one. 

### Some 'Edge' terms used in Graph Theory:

- Tree Edge: A tree edge is an edge in a DFS tree that connects a parent vertex to its child vertex. In other words, a tree edge is created whenever a vertex is visited for the first time and an unvisited adjacent vertex or vertices are found. 
- Back Edge: A back edge is an edge that connects a descendant edge to its predecessor, back edges are used to identify cycles in a graph.
- Forward Edge: Forward edge connects a vertex to its descendant that is not its direct child. To put it simply, a forward edge is created when we move "forward" in the DFS tree to a vertex that is not an immediate child of the current vertex. These edges can be found in directed graphs and can indicate the presence of a "shortcut" or "bypass" path from one part of the graph to another.
- Cross Edge: A cross edge connects two vertices in different branches of the DFS tree, neither of which is an ancestor or a descendant of the other. During a DFS traversal, a cross edge is encountered when we explore an unvisited vertex that is not a neighbor of the current vertex in the DFS tree.

### Implementation:

#### Recursive:

```java
public void dfsRecursive(int start, boolean[] visited, Graph graph) {
    visited[start] = true;
    System.out.print(start + " ");

    for (int neighbor : graph.getNeighbors(start)) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            dfsRecursive(neighbor, visited, graph);
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, `start` represents the starting vertex, `visited` is an array of boolean values that keeps track of which vertices have been visited, and `graph` is the graph being traversed.

The `dfsRecursive` method first marks the current vertex as visited and prints it. Then, for each unvisited neighbor of the current vertex, it recursively calls the `dfsRecursive` method on that neighbor.

#### Iterative:

```java
public void dfsIterative(int start, Graph graph) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[graph.getNumVertices()];
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

    visited[start] = true;
    stack.push(start);

    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        int vertex = stack.pop();
        System.out.print(vertex + " ");

        for (int neighbor : graph.getNeighbors(vertex)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                stack.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, `start` represents the starting vertex, `graph` is the graph being traversed, and `visited` is an array of boolean values that keeps track of which vertices have been visited.

The `dfsIterative` method first initializes a stack to store the vertices to be visited, marks the starting vertex as visited, and pushes it onto the stack. Then, it enters a loop that continues as long as the stack is not empty. In each iteration of the loop, the method pops a vertex off the stack, prints it, and then adds its unvisited neighbors to the stack.

### Breadth First Search: 

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it visits all the vertices at the same distance from the starting vertex before moving to vertices that are farther away.

To perform BFS, we start from a given vertex and explore all its neighbors first before moving on to the neighbors of its neighbors. This is done by maintaining a queue of vertices to be visited next. We add the starting vertex to the queue, mark it as visited, and then repeatedly dequeue the front vertex, mark its unvisited neighbors as visited, and add them to the back of the queue until the queue is empty.

BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, as it always visits vertices in order of their distance from the starting vertex. It can also be used to detect cycles and connected components in a graph, and to solve other graph-related problems.

### Implementation:

#### Recursive:

```java
public void bfsRecursive(int start, Graph graph) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[graph.getNumVertices()];
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

    visited[start] = true;
    queue.add(start);

    bfsRecursiveHelper(visited, queue, graph);
}

private void bfsRecursiveHelper(boolean[] visited, Queue<Integer> queue, Graph graph) {
    if (queue.isEmpty()) {
        return;
    }

    int vertex = queue.poll();
    System.out.print(vertex + " ");

    for (int neighbor : graph.getNeighbors(vertex)) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            visited[neighbor] = true;
            queue.add(neighbor);
        }
    }

    bfsRecursiveHelper(visited, queue, graph);
}
```

In this implementation, `start` represents the starting vertex, `graph` is the graph being traversed, `visited` is an array of boolean values that keeps track of which vertices have been visited, and `queue` is a data structure used to store the vertices to be visited.

The `bfsRecursive` method first initializes the `visited` array and the `queue`, marks the starting vertex as visited and adds it to the queue, and then calls the `bfsRecursiveHelper` method to perform the actual BFS traversal.

The `bfsRecursiveHelper` method is a recursive helper method that performs the BFS traversal. It first checks if the queue is empty, and if so, returns. Otherwise, it dequeues the front vertex, prints it, adds its unvisited neighbors to the queue, and then recursively calls itself with the updated `visited` array and `queue`.

#### Iterative implementation:

```java
public void bfsIterative(int start, Graph graph) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[graph.getNumVertices()];
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

    visited[start] = true;
    queue.add(start);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int vertex = queue.poll();
        System.out.print(vertex + " ");

        for (int neighbor : graph.getNeighbors(vertex)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                queue.add(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}
