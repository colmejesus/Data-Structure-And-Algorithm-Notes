 Implementing a binary tree using an Array is one of the simpler implementations of a Binary Tree when compared to other implementations like Linked List. In this implementation, the left and right child of a root are represented by the indices of an array.

In a Binary Tree Represented using an array, the Left child of a node is stored at index 2*i+1 ('i' is the index of the node whose left child we are trying to find) and the Right Child of a node is stored at index 2*i+2. In the Binary tree above we can look at the leaf node let's say 50, which is the left child of the node 25, the index of 50 which can be found using 2*i+1 which is equal to 2 x 2+1 = 5 and as you can check in the given array, 50 is stored at the index 5, now if we look at the right child 40, its index can be found using 2*i+2 which is 2x2+2=6, which is exactly where it is stored in the array. You can similarly find the index of any left or right node, provided that you know the array index of their parent node. 

This representation isn't commonly used over implementations done using a different data structure for example a linked list, is however, memory efficient and might get used in places like embedded systems. It isn't as flexible as a linked list based Binary Tree, as it stores data on a contiguous block of memory. But, these properties of Binary Tree make it a better option for certain operations like sorting, transferring a Tree over a network and for calculating its size and height.

## Implementation: 

```java
Class ArrayTree{
	int arr[];
	int treesize;
	public ArrayTree(int s){
	treesize=s;
	arr=new arr[treesize];
	}
void setRoot(int data) {
	arr[0]=data;
}	
void InsertNode(int parent, int data, char pos){
	int index;
	if(pos=='L') {
		index=parent*2+1;
		arr[index]=data;
	}
	else if(pos=='R') {
		index=parent*2+2;
		arr[index]=data;
}
	else {
	System.out.print("Invalid Position");
	}
	}
void printTree() {
	for(int i=0; i<treesize; i++) {
	System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
	}
}	
}

public class ArrayTest {

public static void main([String args]) {
	ArrayTree T1=new ArrayTree;
	T1.setRoot(25)
	T1.insertNode(0, 35, 'R');
	T1.insertNode(0, 30, 'L');
	T1.insertNode(1, 22, 'R');
	T1.insertNode(1, 10, 'L');
	T1.insertNode(2, 50, 'L');
	T1.insertNode(2, 40, 'R');
	T1.printTree();

}

}

```
