### What's an adjacency matrix?

An adjacency matrix is a square matrix representation of a graph where each row and column corresponds to a group of vertices in a graph, and the value at the intersection of the row and column, which is either 0 or 1, represents weather those vertices are connected by an edge or not suppose there are two vertices/nodes (2)(3), if there is an edge between *$2$* and *$3$* the intersection between $2$ and $3$ in the matrix will have a 1 representing that there is an edge between two nodes, if not the intersection will consist of a 0. 

Here's a pictorial representation of an adjacency matrix:

### What's an Adjacency List?

Adjacency list is also used to store information about a graph, i.e. an array of lists which stores the neighbor of each vertex as a list, the order of neighbors stored in link lists do not matter.

Here's how an adjacency list might look, it's an array of singly link lists, which is storing the neighbor vertices of each vertex in the form of link lists and the lists are stored in an array:
